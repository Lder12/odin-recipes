        <img src="franvegan.jpg" alt="Photo of a Vegan Francesinha">
            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Like a Portuguese version of a Croque Monsieur, 
        only with far more meat and a tomatoey, 
        beery sauce which you can spice up with some chilli, if preferred. 
        Belly busting and described as a 'heart attack on a plate', 
        this is a food that is local to Porto and made in a few different ways. 
        I had it at the St Johns Festival and it was amazing and is a local speciality in Porto.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season the seitan slices with salt, pepper, garlic and soy sauce. Grill them and also the cut sausages and the mushrooms.</li>
                    <li>Display 4 bread slices in a tray.</li>
                    <li>On each bread slice display the seitan, the sausages, the ham, the mushrooms, the tomato slices and another slice of bread on the top.</li>
                    <li>Display the cheese slices in order to cover the bread on the top, and after melting a little they should cover all the sides.</li>
                    <li>ake the tray to the oven at 200º C just to warm up and melt the cheese.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by adding all the ingredients in a food processer to mix everything. Take it to boil, taste it and rectify the seasoning if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Serve each “francesinha” with the hot sauce on it. Some French fries combine very well with it.</li>
