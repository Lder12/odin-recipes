            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Like a Portuguese version of a Croque Monsieur, 
        only with far more meat and a tomatoey, 
        beery sauce which you can spice up with some chilli, if preferred. 
        Belly busting and described as a 'heart attack on a plate', 
        this is a food that is local to Porto and made in a few different ways. 
        I had it at the St Johns Festival and it was amazing and is a local speciality in Porto.</p>
